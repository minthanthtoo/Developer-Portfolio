# Project Media Plan

Each project has its own folder with 4 image slots:

- `highlight.png` (main hero image / best showcase shot)
- `live-01.png` (live product screenshot)
- `live-02.png`
- `live-03.png`

How to use:
1. Paste your screenshots into each project folder.
2. Keep these exact file names so no code change is needed.
3. If you prefer JPG/WebP, update that project `images` array in `constants.tsx`.
